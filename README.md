## Overview

`battery` provides a cross-platform unified API to a notebook batteries state.

Its main goal is to wrap the OS-specific interfaces, cover all the hacks and legacy cases
and get the batteries information (such as state of charge, energy rate, voltage and temperature)
as a typed values, recalculated as necessary to be returned as a [SI measurement units](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/).

## Supported platforms

* Linux 2.6.39+
* MacOS 10.10+
* iOS
* Windows 7+
* FreeBSD
* DragonFlyBSD

## Install

As a prerequisite, `battery` crate requires at least Rustc version **1.36** or greater.

Add the following line into a `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
battery = "0.7.5"
```

## Examples

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), battery::Error> {
    let manager = battery::Manager::new()?;

    for (idx, maybe_battery) in manager.batteries()?.enumerate() {
        let battery = maybe_battery?;
        println!("Battery #{}:", idx);
        println!("Vendor: {:?}", battery.vendor());
        println!("Model: {:?}", battery.model());
        println!("State: {:?}", battery.state());
        println!("Time to full charge: {:?}", battery.time_to_full());
        println!("");
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

See the `battery/examples/` folder in the [repository](https://github.com/svartalf/rust-battery/blob/master/battery/examples/simple.rs)
for additional examples.

## FFI bindings

Experimental [battery-ffi](https://crates.io/crates/battery-ffi) crate provides the FFI bindings to the `battery` crate,
so it can be used with other languages, such as C, Python or NodeJS.

Check its [README](https://github.com/svartalf/rust-battery/tree/master/battery-ffi)
and [documentation](https://docs.rs/battery-ffi) for details.

## Users

This an incomplete list of the `battery` crate users. If you are using it too,
send me a message and I'll add your project here!

### battop

[`battop`](https://github.com/svartalf/rust-battop) is an interactive viewer,
similar to `top`, `htop` and other \*top utilities, but about the batteries installed in your notebook.\
It is using the `battery` crate API to show the batteries information in your terminal.

### starship

[`starship`](https://github.com/starship/starship) is a Rust port of the minimalistic, powerful,
and extremely customizable prompt Spaceship ZSH.\
It is using the `battery` crate to show the the current battery level and status in a shell prompt.

Here is what [@matchai](https://github.com/matchai) says:

> I really appreciate how easily we were able to get your library up and running!
> Battery APIs were a headache for us in predecessors of this project üòÖ
